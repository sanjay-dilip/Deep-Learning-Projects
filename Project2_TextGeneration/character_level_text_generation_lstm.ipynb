    "**What happens:**\n",
    "- **`set(text)`** ‚Üí Extracts unique characters from the text\n",
    "- **`list(...)`** ‚Üí Converts set back to a list\n",
    "- **`sorted(...)`** ‚Üí Arranges characters in consistent order\n",
    "- **Result:** A sorted list of 46 unique characters\n",

    "### 1. Setting Sequence Parameters\n",
    "```python\n",

    "step = 3         # step size between sequences\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why These Values?**\n",
    "- **40-character sequences:** Long enough to capture meaningful context, short enough for efficient training\n",
    "- **3-character step:** Creates sufficient overlap while maintaining data diversity\n",
    "- **Optimal balance:** Maximizes training examples without excessive memory usage\n",

    "## Defining the RNN Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The model architecture consists of the following layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Embedding Layer:  \n",
    "   - Converts integer-encoded characters into dense vectors of fixed size.  \n",
    "   - Helps the network learn a distributed representation of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. LSTM Layer:  \n",
    "   - A type of RNN capable of learning long-term dependencies.  \n",
    "   - Chosen for its ability to retain information over longer sequences compared to vanilla RNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Dense Output Layer:  \n",
    "   - A fully connected layer with a softmax activation.  \n",
    "   - Produces a probability distribution over the next character in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "This configuration is implemented using the TensorFlow Keras API.\n",

    "## What This Code Accomplishes\n",
